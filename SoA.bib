abstract = {Lung cancer seems to be the common cause of death among people throughout the world. Early detection of lung cancer can increase the chance of survival among people. The overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer patients increases from 14 to 49{\%} if the disease is detected in time. Although Computed Tomography (CT) can be more efficient than X-ray. However, problem seemed to merge due to time constraint in detecting the present of lung cancer regarding on the several diagnosing method used. Hence, a lung cancer detection system using image processing is used to classify the present of lung cancer in an CT-images. In this study, MATLAB have been used through every procedures made. In image processing procedures, process such as image pre-processing, segmentation and feature extraction have been discussed in detail. We are aiming to get the more accurate results by using various enhancement and segmentation techniques.},

abstract = {The detection of lung cancer through image processing is an important tool for diagnoses. Different methods were employed to detect the cancerous cell of a lung with image pre processing such as Gabor filter, image segmentation using watershed segmentation and feature extraction by using MATLAB. In this experiment, various Computed Tomography (CT) images of lung were used as input image and obtained the output image in JPEG format. The resultant output of this technique was evaluated. Based on the results, it shows that watershed segmentation technique is showed better results than other segmentation techniques for lung cancer cell identification.},

In this paper, we propose a level set-active contour model with minimizer function for lung tumor diagnosis and segmentation. Kernel based non-local neighborhood denoising function is used to get noise free image. Second order histogram based feature extraction is accomplished for classifying the images under normal and abnormal classes. Following tumor detection, exact segmentation of the tumor is effected by level set-active contour modeling with minimized gradient. Experiments demonstrated that our methodology could segment the lung field with pathology of variant forms more precisely. I.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19(th) century, medical imageology has progressed for 100 years, and medical imaging has become an important auxiliary tool for clinical diagnosis. With the launch of the human genome project (HGP) and the development of various high-throughput detection techniques, disease exploration in the post-genome era has extended beyond investigations of structural changes to in-depth analyses of molecular abnormalities in tissues, organs and cells, on the basis of gene expression and epigenetics. These techniques have given rise to genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and other systems biology subspecialties, including radiogenomics. Radiogenomics is an important revolution in the traditional visually identifiable imaging technology and constitutes a new branch, radiomics. Radiomics is aimed at extracting quantitative imaging features automatically and developing models to predict lesion phenotypes in a non-invasive manner. Here, we summarize the advent and development of radiomics, the basic process and challenges in clinical practice, with a focus on applications in pulmonary nodule evaluations, including diagnostics, pathological and molecular classifications, treatment response assessments and prognostic predictions, especially in radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; however, early diagnosis of lung cancer leads to higher survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that scanning with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) led to a 20{\%} reduction in mortality rate in a high-risk population. This paper covers new developments in screening eligibility criteria and the possible benefits and the harm of screening with CT. To make the screening process more feasible and help reduce the rate of missed lung nodules, computer-aided detection (CAD) has been introduced to assist radiologists in lung nodule detection. The aim of this paper is to review how CAD works, its performance in lung nodule detection, and the factors that influence its performance. This paper also aims to investigate the effect of different types of CAD on CT in lung nodule detection and the effect of CAD on radiologists' decision outcomes.},

abstract = {radiomics In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.},

abstract = {Characterization of lung nodules as benign or malignant is one of the most important tasks in lung cancer diagnosis, staging and treatment planning. While the variation in the appearance of the nodules remains large, there is a need for a fast and robust computer aided system. In this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable multi-view deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for nodule characterization. First, we use median intensity projection to obtain a 2D patch corresponding to each dimension. The three images are then concatenated to form a tensor, where the images serve as different channels of the input image. In order to increase the number of training samples, we perform data augmentation by scaling, rotating and adding noise to the input image. The trained network is used to extract features from the input image followed by a Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain the malignancy score. We also empirically establish the significance of different high level nodule attributes such as calcification, sphericity and others for malignancy determination. These attributes are found to be complementary to the deep multi-view CNN features and a significant improvement over other methods is obtained.},

Investigators have been encouraged to publish their clinical and imaging data as part of fulfilling their grant obligations. Realizing it was not sufficient to merely ask investigators to publish their collection of imaging and clinical data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created the open source National Biomedical Image Archive software package as a mechanism for centralized hosting of cancer related imaging. NCI has contracted with Washington University in Saint Louis to create The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)---an open-source, open-access information resource to support research, development, and educational initiatives utilizing advanced medical imaging of cancer. In its first year of operation, TCIA accumulated 23 collections (3.3 million images). Operating and maintaining a high-availability image archive is a complex challenge involving varied archive-specific resources and driven by the needs of both image submitters and image consumers. Quality archives of any type (traditional library, PubMed, refereed journals) require management and customer service. This paper describes the management tasks and user support model for TCIA.",
