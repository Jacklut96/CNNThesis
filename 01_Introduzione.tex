This document contains the documentation of the "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for " project. This project aims to provide a solution to the problem introduced in this chapter through CNN and their develop.

\section{Context and problem definition}
The Convolutional Neural Network is ment to be employed in diagnostic to overcome the presence of human errors in the valuation of CT and PET images. Furthermore, it proposes a more exact and effective solution in less time and it reduces the work load of the radiologist.
The cancer is a uncontrolled and invasive growth of tissue due to a somatic mutation of the DNA of a cell. This neoplastic cell stops its specific function and starts to clone itself without a limit. The continous grouth produces an agglomerated tissue that does not perforn any kind of activity which is usefull to the organanism to survive. The tissue replaces competitively the normal tissue causing the malfunction of the affected organ. This volume growth vaniches any termination surgical therapy.

The human evaluation of lung nodules can introduce many errors related to the need to provide an evaluation as quickly as possible because of the large amount of images per patient to analyze, of the difficulty to detect the small tumoral masses not completely vascularized with a low glucose metabolism and reduced captation of contrast medium.
The necessity of an early diagnosis that allows a radical and targeted therapeutic approach it has to be highlighted before the invasion of the  surrounding structures by the tumor with the patient's clinical cure.

Nowadays, the field that implements models to identify nodules inside the human body is Radiomics: it is a field of medical study that aim to extract qualitative features from medical images using data characterisaion agorithm.
Radiomic algorithms perform a segmentation of the images which provides the recognition of shapes and then improove the image parameters in order to extract the features. This features contains the informations which allow to get a classification and the identification of a tumor mass.
The main problem of this approach is that each different body region needs a specific method of segmentation and feature extraction. Thus, our aim is to perform a CNN Body Region Recognition in order to provide at each algorithm the specific body region for which it was developed, so decreasing the computational times.

\section{Proposed solution}
The CNNs are widely used for recognizing objects in images: in the state of the art there is no mention of the use of this architecture for lung cancer detection so our aim is to introduce a new effective method to speed up diagnostics.
Our purpose is to build an algorithm that takes in imput all the images from a CT exam of a patient and gives as output the location in terms of number of slices of a lung nodule.

\subsection{CNN principles}
Convolutional Neural Networks are made up of artificial neurons that have learnable weights and biases, each neuron receives inputs and performs a dot product. The network produces a score function: from the raw image pixels to class scores. 
Neural Network has to be trained to work properly. The training, consists of a process in which the net works with images already classified, in order to make the network capable of modifying its weights based on the type of images. Thanks to this training, the net can fully operate the right classification on new images.

\subsection{.dicom files}
Medical images or more in general medical datas have to be standardized in order to read all medical exams and patient information in the same way by anyone. This standard is Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), it provides a standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data.
About medical imaging and related data, the CT images are related with a header which provide all the information about patient and technical details on the methods of examination. In the header there are information about machinaries, size, padding values, high bit of aquisition and the pixel array of images; this allow to implement the right changes to the images in order to provide to the network files of the same type with identical characteristics.
