abstract = {Characterization of lung nodules as benign or malignant is one of the most important tasks in lung cancer diagnosis, staging and treatment planning. While the variation in the appearance of the nodules remains large, there is a need for a fast and robust computer aided system. In this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable multi-view deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for nodule characterization. First, we use median intensity projection to obtain a 2D patch corresponding to each dimension. The three images are then concatenated to form a tensor, where the images serve as different channels of the input image. In order to increase the number of training samples, we perform data augmentation by scaling, rotating and adding noise to the input image. The trained network is used to extract features from the input image followed by a Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain the malignancy score. We also empirically establish the significance of different high level nodule attributes such as calcification, sphericity and others for malignancy determination. These attributes are found to be complementary to the deep multi-view CNN features and a significant improvement over other methods is obtained.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; however, early diagnosis of lung cancer leads to higher survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that scanning with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) led to a 20{\%} reduction in mortality rate in a high-risk population. This paper covers new developments in screening eligibility criteria and the possible benefits and the harm of screening with CT. To make the screening process more feasible and help reduce the rate of missed lung nodules, computer-aided detection (CAD) has been introduced to assist radiologists in lung nodule detection. The aim of this paper is to review how CAD works, its performance in lung nodule detection, and the factors that influence its performance. This paper also aims to investigate the effect of different types of CAD on CT in lung nodule detection and the effect of CAD on radiologists' decision outcomes.},

abstract = {radiomics In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.},
